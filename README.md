# Skills
## Planning

* Whilst working in Local Government, one of my duties was to deliver elections at European, National and Local level. To ensure that elections are delivered to a high standard and complies with legislation, planning is essential. <b>Project planning is one of my strengths</b>, I achieved the <b>Prince2 Foundation Certification</b> whilst at University. I would frequently utilise my knowledge of planning projects at my time working in Local Government. An example of this is planning for the Annual Canvass, a six month period in which Election Officers go through to update the Electoral Register for publication at the end of the year. I would be responsible for putting together a Project Plan which included, tasks to be completed, members of the team responsible for tasks, estimated time to complete and statuory deadlines. 

* At Makers, I would apply my knowledge of planning to many group [projects](#projects) I collaborated on. Before writing any code, we would identify our MVP(Minimum Viable Product). Using tools such as Trello and Balsamiq, we can begin to visualize our product and begin brain storming features we require. Alongside this, we would adopt more agile practises like morning stand ups, an opportunity to discuss the project, the teams role etc., and retros, a time for reflection and general wellbeing check in. 

## Communication

* In my previous role, communication was essential. I would be invovled in regular conversation with the Cabinet Office and Electoral Commission to ensure I was complying with legislation. Alongside this, it was important to frequently communicate with key members of Political Parties so they received regular support when needed. It was not just limited to these organisations, my position relied on me to communicate to all stakeholders involved in the democratic process, i.e. the public, internal, suppliers, venues etc. 

* Since graduating from Makers, I have developed my communication skills further. The course would encourage pair programming ensuring that you collaborate with new devs. Driving and navigating during pair programming has allowed me to be more methodical in my approach whilst communicating to my pair my thought processes whilst driving. A navigator will observe the driver and review the code, it adopts a different perspective where you are required to learn to listen. 

## Attention to detail
* My previous work with elections included overseeing the publication of registers, public notices, ballot papers and various other documents. Often I would be proofreading legal documentation that would be publicly available. It required incredible attention to detail to ensure it was correct. 

* On my journey to become a software developer, having attention to detail has proved to be extremely important. An example of this, although simple can be the most difficult error to debug. Spotting spelling mistakes, white spaces, indentations can be trivial on occasions but being able to spot them has made my journey of de-bugging much more simple allowing me to delve deeper into the issue if it persists. 

## Problem Solving
My experience in delivering elections has enhanced my capabilities to solve problems effectively. On many occasions, I would be faced with difficulties and would try to find solutions to them. The May elections in 2021 was a great example of this, delivering successful elections during a pandemic.

During my time with Makers, I would encounter just as many issues I would be required to solve. My approach is systematic and in some instances, I timebox my learning to ensure I understand the problem and then carefully think about how to find a solution.
